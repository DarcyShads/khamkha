			Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
			goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
			night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the
			naked eye in broad daylight.Venus]lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
			appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after
			dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the
			Sun every 224.7 Earth days.Venus It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth
			days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence,
			it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the
			Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus.
			This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.Venus does not
			have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the
			planets in the Solar System.Venus

			Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister
			planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and
			bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.
			It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting
			of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's
			surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the
			pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is
			closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the
			Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is
			shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid,
			preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have
			had water oceans in the past,Venus but these would have vaporized as the
			temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.Venus The water has
			probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
			interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary
			magnetic field.Venus

			As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture
			in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made
			sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
			writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the
			first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the
			second millennium BC.Venus
		</p>
		<p>
			Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early
			interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited
			by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961), and the first to be successfully
			landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venusian thick clouds render observation
			of its surface impossible in visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps
			did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans
			have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are
			hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions. The possibility of life on
			Venus has long been a topic of speculation, and in recent years has
			received active research.

			Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct
			information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of
			Venus.Venus The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth
			suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and
			crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least
			partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the
			same rate,Venus although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.Venus
			The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its
			deep interior than Earth's.Venus The predicted values for the moment of
			inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900-3,450
			km.Venus This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of
			3,500 km.Venus
