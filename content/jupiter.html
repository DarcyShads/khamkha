			Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
			System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that
			of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less
			than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest
			natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. People
			have been observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the
			Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes
			one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky
			core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks
			a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of its interior
			generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of
			its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid; it has a
			slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is
			visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with
			turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent
			result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm known to have existed
			since at least the 17th century when telescopes first saw it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful
			magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU;
			500 million mi) long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit.
			Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four
			large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa,
			Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the size of Earth's Moon;
			Callisto is almost the size of the planet Mercury, and Ganymede is even
			larger. Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its
			closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been
			explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the
			Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the
			Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, the New
			Horizons visited Jupiter using its gravity to increase its speed, bending
			its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet,
			Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. Future targets for
			exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid
			ocean of Europa.

		<p>
			Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume.
			Since helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's
			atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the
			remaining one percent consisting of other elements. The atmosphere
			contains trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and
			silicon-based compounds. There are also fractional amounts of carbon,
			ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The
			outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia.
			Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene
			and other hydrocarbons have also been found. The interior of Jupiter
			contains denser materialsâ€”by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium,
			and 5% other elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			The atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the
			theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula. Neon in the upper
			atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a
			tenth as abundant as in the Sun. Helium is also depleted to about 80% of
			the Sun's helium composition. This depletion is a result of precipitation
			of these elements as helium-rich droplets deep in the interior of the
			planet.
